# Microstructure Data

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing microstructure data, which involves detailed examination and processing of materials' microstructural features. The project includes data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization techniques to understand the properties and behaviors of different materials.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks and Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Excel

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing microstructure data for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Applying statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to analyze the data.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating visual representations of the microstructural features.
- **Excel Integration**: Utilizing Excel for data storage and initial processing.

## Data Analysis
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing the basic features of the data.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying relationships between different microstructural parameters.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing models to predict material properties based on microstructural features.
- **Visualization**: Generating plots and charts to visualize data distributions and model predictions.

## Data Provided
The Excel file includes the following features:
- **Microstructure Type**
- **Microstructure Image**
- **Cooling Rate**
- **Deformation Temperature**
